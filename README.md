# 🚀 NestJS Backend API — Zero to Hero Project

## 📌 Overview
This project is a production-style backend REST API built using NestJS and TypeScript as part of the "NestJS Zero to Hero - Modern TypeScript Back-end Development" Udemy course.

It demonstrates my ability to design and develop scalable backend systems using modern best practices including authentication, database integration, and modular architecture.

---

## 🧠 Key Highlights
- Built scalable REST APIs using NestJS
- Implemented JWT authentication & authorization
- Applied DTO validation and request sanitization
- Integrated database using TypeORM
- Followed modular and clean architecture
- Environment-based configuration
- Proper error handling and status codes

---

## ▶️ Getting Started

Clone repository:
git clone https://github.com/AAat99/NestJS.git

Install dependencies:
npm install

Create .env file:
DB_HOST=localhost  
DB_PORT=5432  
DB_USERNAME=yourusername  
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword  
DB_NAME=dbname  
JWT_SECRET=yourSecretKey  

Run app:
npm run start:dev

Server runs on:
http://localhost:3000

## 📬 API Testing
Use Postman Client.

Example routes:
POST /auth/signup  
POST /auth/signin  
GET /tasks  
POST /tasks  
PATCH /tasks/:id  
DELETE /tasks/:id
